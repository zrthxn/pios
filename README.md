## kernel project

### About
A barebones operating system kernel which should (at the very least)
be able to give you a terminal and file handling on a Armv8 (AArch64) based SBC.
For this, I'm using the Raspberry Pi 3b+.

**Why?** Just for fun. I like being this close to hardware and its a huge challenge
programming with Rust **without** a standard library and writing safe code.
